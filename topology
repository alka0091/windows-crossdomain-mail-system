# Network Topology

Enterprise-style logical topology for the **Windows Cross-Domain Mail System** project.

This topology illustrates how two independent organizations are deployed using separate Windows Server environments while maintaining cross-domain email communication.

---

## Overview

The environment consists of **two Windows Server 2022 virtual machines**, each acting as a separate organization with its own directory and mail infrastructure.

Each system operates independently with no shared domain or forest, closely simulating real-world enterprise deployments.

This diagram provides a high-level view of internal communication, external access, and cross-domain mail flow.

## Key Components

- **Internet / NAT (Blue NIC)**
  - Provides external connectivity
  - Used for updates and outbound access

- **Host-Only Network (Red NIC)**
  - Isolated internal network
  - Used exclusively for inter-server communication

---

## Server Roles

### VM 1 – Organization A
- Windows Server 2022
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- DNS
- Microsoft Exchange Server 2019

### VM 2 – Organization B
- Windows Server 2022
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- DNS
- Microsoft Exchange Server 2019

---

## Mail Flow

- Cross-domain email delivery using **SMTP**
- Client access via **POP3** and **IMAP4**
- Mail access verified using:
  - Outlook Web Access (OWA)
  - Thunderbird

---

## Design Rationale

This topology demonstrates enterprise-level concepts including:
- Cross-domain mail routing
- Isolated Active Directory environments
- Separation of internal and external network traffic
- Multi-protocol email access

The design reflects real-world system administration practices rather than single-server or guided lab environments.

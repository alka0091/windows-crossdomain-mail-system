# Network Topology

This diagram represents the logical topology of the Windows Cross-Domain Mail System project.

## Overview

The environment consists of two Windows Server 2022 virtual machines configured as separate organizations. Each server hosts its own Active Directory, DNS, and Exchange Server 2019 infrastructure. The systems communicate over an internal host-only network while using NAT for external access.

## Components

- **Internet / NAT (Blue NIC)**
  - Used for updates and external connectivity

- **Host-Only Network (Red NIC)**
  - Isolated internal network
  - Used for inter-server communication

- **VM1 – Organization A**
  - Windows Server 2022
  - Active Directory Domain Services
  - DNS
  - Exchange Server 2019

- **VM2 – Organization B**
  - Windows Server 2022
  - Active Directory Domain Services
  - DNS
  - Exchange Server 2019

## Mail Flow

- Cross-domain email delivery is handled using **SMTP**
- Client access is tested using **POP3** and **IMAP4**
- Email functionality was verified using **Outlook Web Access (OWA)** and **Thunderbird**

This topology simulates a real-world enterprise scenario where independent organizations exchange email without sharing a common domain or forest.
